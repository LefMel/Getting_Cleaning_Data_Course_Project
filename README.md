# Getting_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project
This repo has the solutions to the course project of the course Getting and Cleaning Data offered in Coursera.

Specifically the repo contains 3 files:
1. run_analysis.R - This file contains the R code with the necessary steps to:
    I.  Download Data
    II. Load Data
    III. Merge the training and test datasets to one dataset
    IV. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
    V. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    VI. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
    VII. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
    
2. CodeBook.Rmd - A Rmarkdown file describing the variables, data, and any work performed in the run_analysis.R script to prepare the tidy data set.

3. CodeBook.pdf - A pdf file describing the variables, data, and any work performed in the run_analysis.R script to prepare the tidy data set.

4. final_data.txt - A txt file with the final tidy data set. A 180 x 89 table containing the average of each variable from the sum_data table for each activity and each subject.
